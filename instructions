The library source base manages basic functionality for a library system.

Core domain terminology:

holding: a material available to be borrowed. Identified by a barcode:
               QA1234567:1      the first copy of the material with classification code QA1234567
               QA1234567:2      the 2nd copy of the material with classification code QA1234567
branch: a physical location in the library system that patrons can visit
patron: a person who borrows materials
classification: the Library of Congress code that uniquely identifies a material

The library system codebase is in need of refactoring. Specifically, the checkIn method
in HoldingService.java is a disaster.
